# Assignment 1: Custom Google Map

## Introduction
One of the most prevalent requests for spatial data is user-facing custom maps to lead constituents to key points associated with an organization. In this exercise, we were tasked with choosing a non-profit organization who could leverage an embedded dynamic map, making a prototype that aligns with their mission and design aesthetic.

For nature enthusiests, this region is alluring but intimidating; without sufficient information (which is currently passed through local word-of-mouth) many travellers have died in the parks by drowning or falling. Chico Creek's position as education center positions them perfectly as ambassadors of safe exploration; curating experiences that
