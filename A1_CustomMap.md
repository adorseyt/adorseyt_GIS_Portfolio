# Assignment 1: Custom Google Map

## Introduction
One of the most prevalent requests for spatial data is user-facing custom maps to lead constituents to key points associated with an organization. In this exercise, we were tasked with choosing a non-profit organization who could leverage an embedded dynamic map, making a prototype that aligns with their mission and design aesthetic. I chose the Chico Creek Nature Center, an associate of the Chico Area Recreation and Parks District. Leveraging the organization's logo, I created a palette that is inspired by natural tones of green, blue, and accents of orange and yellow. I then applied this theme to a custom Google Map using the <a href="https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/">Map Styling Wizard</a>. Finally, I created a dynamic map prototype that could be embedded in the organization's site.

## Inspiration: Chico Creek Nature Center
When given the choice, I love to make projects associated with nature, parks and recreation, and eco-tourism. I grew up in Chico California, spending much of my childhood in <a href="https://chico.ca.us/bidwell-park">Bidwell Park</a>, one of the largest municipal parks in the United States. <a href="https://www.chicorec.com/chico-creek-nature-center">Chico Creek Nature Center</a> is dedicated to celebrating the region's natural beauty with programming geared towards all ages. For nature enthusiests, this region is alluring but intimidating; without sufficient information (which is currently passed through local word-of-mouth) many travellers have died in the parks by drowning or falling. Chico Creek's position as education center positions them perfectly as ambassadors of safe exploration; curating experiences that introduce visitors to the park and collecting questions that could lead to better information for non-locals.

Chico Area Recreation has <a href="https://chico.ca.us/bidwell-park-maps">detailed static maps</a> of Bidwell Park's expansive 2,500 acres, but this could be complemented by a custom map that a) caters to Chico Creek Nature Center's own programming; and b) is dynamic and exploratory to help visitors plan their trips. The intersection of need, supporting a personal passion, and opportunity to expand Chico Creek's work makes this a perfect test project.

## Palette Selection
I wanted to create a map that feels custom to Chico Creek, giving them ownership away from Chico Area Recreation so that they have a distinct space to highlight their programming. To this end, I sought a palette that would feel at home with their part of the Chico Area Rec website, but also leverage the colors of the organization's logo:
