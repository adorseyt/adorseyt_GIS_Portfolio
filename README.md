Public Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About Me
My name is Alea Dorsey-Tyler (she/her or they/them), and I am a Masters candidate for Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I love leveraging technology and analytics to help public service providers streamline their operations so they can focus on helping their communities. 

## What I Hope To Learn
With my passion for operations, I'm interested in learning how to create attractive and intuitive online maps to bring insights quickly. I am also interested in leveraging spatial analysis to tackle big problems from a high scale.
